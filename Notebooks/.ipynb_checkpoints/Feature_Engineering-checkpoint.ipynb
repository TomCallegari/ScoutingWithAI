      "A solid scorer at the AHL level. Possesses a good shot and offensive instincts. His lack of consistency has kept him from making an impact in the NHL. (EP 2009)\n",

      "Wirll is a speedy winger who likes to shoot the puck. Works hard all over the ice. Is very strong for his size.- Ulf Andersson, EP\n",
      "Johner plays the game with lots of speed and can score goals as well as set them up. Is an offense-first player.- Ulf Andersson, EP\n",
      "First cousins: Grant Potulny, Ryan Potulny\n",
      "White is a defenseman with a fairly well-rounded game. His offensive qualities include a fine point shot and good passing ability, especially coming out of his own zone. Can step into the play and join the attack. Can be gritty at times, but is on the small side, which limits his effectiveness defensively.- Erik K. Piri, EP (2014)\n",

      "Krebs is a potent point-producer and offensive catalyst that rises to the occasion whenever he's on the ice. He is a smooth, shifty skater that traverses all three zones with ease and closes the gap on the backcheck quickly. Defensively, his understanding of the game communicates itself through his proactive positioning and an active, lane-disrupting stick. Willing to go to the dirty areas and fight for the puck, but isn't at his best there.\r\n",
      "Offensively, below the opposition's blue line, he is an electric, dominant force that showcases excellent decision-making and undeniable puck skills. He's aggressive, but never takes stupid penalties that will put his team in disadvantage state. Krebs' hockey sense is on full display when he's making moves, creating space, and orchestrating opportunities for himself and linemates. All-in-all, Peyton Krebs is an exciting mix of speed, skill, smarts, and hard-nosedness in all three zones. Curtis Joe, EP 2019)\r\n",

He transitions up-ice quickly and is able to create and dictate offensive chances on the rush. He attacks hard and fast and consistently displays excellent puck control. His decision making is very good, indicative of his high level of hockey sense. He plays a complete game and elevates his play as energy levels rise. At the next level, he will need to be even faster and more physically assertive to make his presence felt. All-in-all, an intense, quick-thinking competitor who can elicit a crowd's excitement when he's on the ice. (Curtis Joe, EP 2017)\n",

      "A steady defensive-Defenseman, Dave Sutter has an imposing frame, is a decent skater, moves very well for his size and is an underrated puck-mover. He is a player who does the little things right and will not risk anything if not necessary. Despite his size, he lacks upper body strength, as he still has a lot of room to bulk up. He also needs to learn how to use his towering body to his advantage in front of the net or along the boards. Dave Sutter is a reliable penalty-killer, who uses his long reach to keep opponents to his distance and also is not afraid to block shots. (by Rafik Soliman, February 2014)\n",

Exhibits world-class skating ability, and can blow by defenders just as easily as he can go through them. Stands up for his teammates and never backs down from a challenge. Displays a wicked, NHL-level release that challenges goaltenders of all skill levels. Becoming a recognizable asset when playing a more defensive role as well.

Through maneuvering his way around the ice and making high-percentage, skilled decisions in all three zones, he is able to shut opposition offense down before it begins to take shape. Carlo is a smooth skater who can control the puck very well and get into open areas for scoring chances; that being said, he does and will need help finding offense due to his natural defensive style of play.

Very poised with the puck; calm and controls the play with authority. Has good hands. Without the puck and in high-pressure situations, Juulsen tends to overthink things and can try to do a little too much; that will go away with time and maturity.

Strong on the puck and quick to get on the backcheck. Very active defensively and doesn't give up his own end to dominate offensively. Many smaller players play on the perimiter, but Wong isn't afraid of going to the hard areas and battling for possession. A true all-around player with the drive to compete and win. [EP]\r\n",

He has become a nasty player that the other team dreads whenever he is on the ice. Very few players can match him physically due his monster 6'7 frame, and he uses this to his advantage every game. He is a very consistent player who's offensive game saw improvement during his draft year.  (Tyler Parchem, EP 2016)\n",

      "Bode Wilde is a talented and competitive defender that plays a tenacious 200-foot game. His balance and acceleration in-stride is noteworthy and he is never caught in no-man's land, or doing nothing. He is proactive and hard-nosed in pursuit if puck control, and he reads queues in all three zones naturally and quickly. Defensively, he is a beast and always looks to take time and space away from the opposition. He erases the open lane, keeps opponents to the outside, and is physical along the wall. In-transition, he is able to make that outlet pass or, more than likely, take it up himself to set up the trap. Offensively, he showcases a very hard, accurate shot that leaps off his stick. He can also open up space by way of his skating ability, size, and handling of the puck. Thanks to his quick thinking in making the high-percentage decision, he can be very difficult to read and play against. All-in-all, Wilde is a smart, competitive, and sizey two-way D-man that can provide a team with numbers on the board and stability on the ice. [EP 2018]\n",

Utilizes an active stick and creates turnovers frequently. Could be more proactive in his own end, but has shown progression in understanding lanes and reading unfolding plays; most of his best defensive work comes through the neutral zone, as there is a lot less time and space to work with, and it is in those moments that Boqvist shines. Offensively, Boqvist is electric; he has the toolbox of a top line forward. Slick puckhandling ability paired with excellent vision and positional awareness makes him a dangerous threat every time he is on the ice. He also takes advantage of the attention and bodies he draws towards himself in creating space for teammates.

The neutral zone is his launching pad: he is able to take off into the offensive end, or backcheck quickly into his own end. Very sound positionally. Smooth skater with lots of energy to burn. Not afraid to lay the body, or take a hit to make the play; can and will stand up for teammates. Possesses good hands and awareness on the ice, as well as a hard shot that is quite accurate. All-in-all, a complete defenseman that is relied upon to offset any oncoming attacks, as well as create chances in the opposing end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)\r\n",

      "Nicolas Beaudin is a diminutive yet cunning defenceman that is able to use his size to his advantage. His mobility is all but elite at this point; he primarily uses his speed to open up passing and shooting lanes in the offensive zone. With and without the puck he stays composed and in-position, allowing him to analyze situations effortlessly and make those calculated decisions. Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time. All-in-all, Nicolas Beaudin is an offensive defenceman that understands his own game well and ever seeks to expand upon his strengths. (Curtis Joe, EP 2018)\n",

      "There is so much to like about Joe Veleno. He's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better. The fleet-footed center is unselfish and will primarily look to make a play at top speed; however, when the chance arises to put it in the pot himself, he will capitalize. He sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. His defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. Transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor. If he can find the consistency in refusing to let himself get taken out of plays, especially if he doesn't start them, he will thrive and exceed expectations. (Curtis Joe, EP 2017)\r\n",

      "Pascal Laberge is a tough and spirited two-way forward with a high level of hockey sense. Hunts for turnovers and causes havoc whenever he is on the ice. Uses his size well to shield the puck, exert physical force, and win board battles. Has a good set of goal-scorer's hands, but tends to use them more to pass than anything. All-in-all, an efficient, yet exciting, two-way forward with potential to develop into a playmaking goal scorer. (Curtis Joe, EP 2014)\n",

      "A talented two-way defenceman that can play in all situations and stay productive. Uses his edges well and is, for the most part, a very smooth skater; however, as he gets stronger and adjusts to a more up-tempo style of hockey, he will need to work on his speed in gap-closing. Offensively, he utilizes his keen sense of awareness to be in the right spot at the right time, every time. Soft hands and a deadly shot accentuate his ability to get creative, on occasion. Rock solid defensively, his strong positioning severely limits time and space for the opposition. All-in-all, a well-rounded, reliable, and consistent defenceman that can log a lot of ice time and provide his team with a stable presence on the back end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2017)\n",

Skates very well for his size, and his acceleration is remarkable; his lower body strength generates a lot of power with respect to his mobility. Possesses an absolutely wicked release to his shot, as well as good hands around the net. Has shown some signs of creativity in playmaking; when he plays his game simply, hard on the forecheck, getting into prime-time scoring areas, he can be a very difficult player to contain. Defensively active in his own  end - uses his long reach to knock pucks off opponents' sticks, and isn't afraid to hound and hit; able to quickly transition from defense to offense and move the puck out using his speed. All-in-all, a big-bodied, number-generating forward that has the skill and size to be a force at both ends of the ice. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)\n",

      "Jeremy Roy is a gifted two-way defenceman that establishes his presence on the ice through playing authoritative hockey, with and without the puck. His absolute and total awareness of other players' positions on the ice is a testament to his incredible knowledge of the game. Roy possesses the intangibles of maturity and character that can't be taught, as well as the individual skill that turns heads every time he is on the ice. All-in-all, a highly intelligent defenceman that plays high-percentage hockey and is a catalyst for positive plays in all three zones. (Curtis Joe, EP 2014)\r\n",

Excellent skater with good quickness and top speed. Possesses strong hockey sense and on-ice awareness for both attacking opponents and his teammates and with this ability he can escape fore-checkers and make quick plays, as he sees passing lanes before they open. Has game-breaking abilities and can turn the outcome of a game. Nico Hischier leads by example has the potential to be a top-line center and a clutch player his Team can turn to late in the game.

Sees the ice very well and is creative with his abilities, willing to battle in front of the net and do the things that other players of his size would not. His defensive zone play is fascinating because he is always very proactive positionally; that being said, his style of defensive play is not very refined, and ill-suited to a more physical brand of hockey. All-in-all, a distinguished two-way competitor that will have the potential to develop into a crafty offensive producer as he gets stronger. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)\n",

      "Filip Zadina is a dynamic offensive forward that plays a complete game. A deft and agile skater, he exhibits explosive mobility both up and down the ice. In all three zones, he proactively looks to create problems for the opposition. His awareness is indicative of his high level of hockey sense, and he knows how to make plays and scoring chances materialize. Has a goal scorer's toolbox, complete with the individual puck skills that one comes to expect from today's elite offensive players. The accurate release on his shot is noteworthy and is a defining aspect of his offensive capabilities. Defensively sound, he disrupts lanes and pressures the opposition to make hasty decisions; he is tenacious in pursuit of puck control and transitions up-ice naturally. All-in-all, Zadina can be categorized as both a two-way forward with a well-rounded game and a dominant offensive force. (Curtis Joe, EP 2018)\r\n",

In all three zones, he proactively looks to create problems for the opposition. His awareness is indicative of his high level of hockey sense, and he knows how to make plays and scoring chances materialize. Has a goal scorer's toolbox, complete with the individual puck skills that one comes to expect from today's elite offensive players. The accurate release on his shot is noteworthy and is a defining aspect of his offensive capabilities. Defensively sound, he disrupts lanes and pressures the opposition to make hasty decisions; he is tenacious in pursuit of puck control and transitions up-ice naturally.

Very naturally gifted skater who moves around the ice with ease. Excels in pressure situations and uses his vision to predict where the puck is going to be, and proactively gets his body into a position where he can either take it away or take off up the ice. Offensively, he has a very creative streak, and knows what kinds of plays he can make in all situations; he also has an exceptional release on his shot, which he can get off quickly. Defensively, he is a buzzsaw that will not let up on the opposition, creating problems for them by causing turnovers and playing strong positionally.

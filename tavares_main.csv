5627,Canada,"Sep 20, 1990",9223,John Tavares,185.0,Mississauga,C,"Tavares has excellent offensive instincts and has a fantastic ability to find open space in his team's offensive zone. His shot is already on a high level in NHL standards and his stickhandling is phenomenal. Tavares isn't the best skater but he is always explosive after entering the opposing team's zone.

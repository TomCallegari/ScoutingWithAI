				Presentation Stages - Scouting Wth AI

Title Page

Intro	

	“It’s not a science, it’s definitely an art.”

	Kevin Cheveldayoff, Winnipeg Jets GM

	“The hardest part is the judging truly doesn’t come for years to come. 
	The big thing about the draft is it’s all based on projections. It’s 
	the ability to project and show some blind faith on players that show 
	some attributes that you think can be developed."


	- What is the NHL Draft?
	- What players are available?
	- Why is it important?
	- Why scout with AI?

 Problem Breakdown

	- What is the CHL
	- What data is available?
	- Need to collect enough data to approximate a players projection to some point in future time.
	- What data can be used?
	- How to organize the data?

Data Collection & Storage
	- Web Scraping
		- Eliteprospects.com
			- Scrape player profile URL's
			- Scrape each player profile

	- Deposit raw data into MongoDB

	- Technologies
		- Python
			- Beautiful Soup
			- Pandas

Extraction / Cleaning
	- Pull from MongoDB
	- Transform / Reshape to Tidy Data
	- Wrangle age of each player for each season
	- Reshape qualitative, quantitative and merge with meta

Feature Engineering
	- Create response variable
	- Refactor: birth_region and position
	- Subset needed columns
	- Impute NaN's
	- Scouting text - NLP / Sentiment Analysis
		- Stop words, Word count, Avg word length, Character count, Upper words
		- Stemming, lemmatization and Sentiment analysis
	- Final dataset

Modeling
	- Deep NN (Tensorflow.Keras)
	- Feed forward dense
	- Input layer, 5 hidden layers (1000 units), output layer with softmax

Results
	- f1-scores
	- Weighted average

Debrief / Future Considerations
	- Debrief
		- What would I do differently?
			- Cleaner NLP (names, mispellings, hockey intuition)
			- Use Scrapy and not BeautifulSoup
			- Scrape other sites to fill in blank data (hopefully)
			- Find more scouting blurbs
	- Future considerations
		- Increased data completeness and addtional scouting blurbs
		- Psychological data (family history, education, personality profiles, etc.)
			- There is quite a bit of noise in the model, some of which could 
			  potentially be explained with quantified mental / psychological data 
			  or some useful proxy.

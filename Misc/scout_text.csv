Very mobile skater who moves up and down the ice quickly, with acute recognition of puck and body position. His maturity and poise is actualized in his high-percentage decision-making, with and without the puck, as well as his proactive stick and body play. Very stable defensively and always takes his lane, but is quick to rush the puck up the ice as he recognizes and accounts for how much time his team is spending in their own end. All-in-all, a quick-thinking defenceman that, honestly lacking nothing, has the potential to develop into a reliable two-way defenceman. (Curtis Joe, EP 2016)

Uses his edges well and is, for the most part, a very smooth skater; however, as he gets stronger and adjusts to a more up-tempo style of hockey, he will need to work on his speed in gap-closing. Offensively, he utilizes his keen sense of awareness to be in the right spot at the right time, every time. Soft hands and a deadly shot accentuate his ability to get creative, on occasion. Rock solid defensively, his strong positioning severely limits time and space for the opposition. All-in-all, a well-rounded, reliable, and consistent defenceman that can log a lot of ice time and provide his team with a stable presence on the back end. (Curtis Joe, EP 2017)"

David Desharnais is a quick skater with decent speed and despite his lack of size, the diminutive pivot battles hard along the boards for loose pucks and is hard to push of balance. Needs to play a more reliable two-way game, as he sometimes misses his assignments in the defensive zone, while chasing the puck and leaving his position. He is an excellent playmaking complement to a sniper on a scoring line. (by Rafik Soliman, February 2014)

Galchenyuk isn’t flashy, but a powerful skater with tremendous edge work, as he can glide through the offensive zone like on rails and combined with his marvelous puck skills he can get himself into the scoring area. Needs to improve his play without the puck, as he’s better suited on the wing, instead the center-position. Has good size and is not afraid to play physical. Owns a very good shot and tends to shoot at sight, which makes Galchenyuk a dangerous Power Play-forward. (by Rafik Soliman, February 2016)

1427,252480,"A phenominal two-way power forward who thrives under pressure. He brings versatility, being able to play as a center or a winger, as well as elite skill and agility. His athleticism is exemplified in his strong skating that allows him to backcheck hard, explode up the ice in-transition, or propel himself up into hits that opponents won't soon forget. His defensive zone play is excellent; he proactively finds and takes away shooting and passing lanes, and makes it tough on opponents to pinpoint any daylight. When he is on the ice, he is uncontainable and leads the forecheck; he creates the time and space for himself to be creative with the puck and finds a way to get it to the back of the net. He makes the players around him better, serving as an example of what hard work and skill can and will be able to produce. A similarly punishing two-way forward with size and zero deficiencies, Anze Kopitar, is the type of player Dubois will aspire to become at the next level. Pierre-Luc Dubois has the potential to develop into an elite two-way forward who excels as a positive catalyst in every facet of the roles he can play, be it the dynamic scorer, the set-up man, the intimidating power forward, or the defensive-minded shutdown guy.

Plays a hard-nosed game and uses his size to establish his presence around the net. Has good hands, an accurate shot, and zero compromise hockey sense. His skating and overall balance off the rush and in-transition is a work in progress that is continuing to get better by the day. That being said, his vision is excellent and his offensive talent is apparent; he is able to play at a fast pace. Being able to keep up is a big part of that, and, moving forward, he has the potential to develop into a strong two-way winger that is hard to play against and can be relied on in all situations.

Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time.

Defensively, his understanding of the game communicates itself through his proactive positioning and an active, lane-disrupting stick. Willing to go to the dirty areas and fight for the puck, but isn't at his best there.
Offensively, below the opposition's blue line, he is an electric, dominant force that showcases excellent decision-making and undeniable puck skills. He's aggressive, but never takes stupid penalties that will put his team in disadvantage state. Krebs' hockey sense is on full display when he's making moves, creating space, and orchestrating opportunities for himself and linemates.

He forces things to happen, and is a catalyst for positive plays at both ends of the ice. Under pressure, he calm and poised, focusing on his own game rather than what is going through other players' minds. He is an excellent skater with a high level of hockey sense, and he realizes his role in all situations. He has great vision and has a deceptively strong shot that he must use more often.

Plays at his best when he simplifies his game, seeing the ice well and finding the open space to give himself decision-making options. Possesses a sharp, accurate shot and needs to use it more. Not a great passer but has the ability to create time and space for teammates who have better options with the puck. Skates very well up-ice but can have some trouble pivoting on the backcheck. Very physical when he wants to be and likes to take key opposition individuals out of the play. Very aggressive. [EP]"

5926,12279,"Bodnarchuk is known as a defenseman with a solid all-around game. Moves the puck well and has a hard shot. A hard worker and quality teammate, he plays bigger than his size would indicate. Also has fine skating ability and agility.- Erik K. Piri, EP (2013)"
5929,45149,Brother: Anthony Beauvillier
5930,1715,"A fast skater and an excellent forechecker. Plays an intense and tough game despite his size. Good stickhandler and passer. Has a quick shot. Possesses a terrific work ethic and agitator qualities. A very good teammate.  
The lack of size and strength can hold him back at times. That, in combination with his gung-ho style could lead to injury problems in the future. Pettersson sometimes tends to over-backcheck at times and leave his man open at the point.- Erik K. Piri, EP (2012)"

5988,205148,"A talented scoring forward that can play either as a center or on the wing; plays with the bite and intensity of a guy who is willing to do anything to win a game. Possesses dynamic skating ability that allows him to accelerate rapidly with each step, incredible hockey sense, electrifying puckhandling skills, and a lightning release on his shot; when you put this skillset together with hard-nosed determination, proactiveness in all three zones, and a physical willingness to grind and persevere, you get a game-changer who can be extremely difficult to play against.

Calm, collected, and poised with the puck; great body and stick positioning without the puck. Reliable at both ends of the ice and can be trusted with a hefty amount of ice time.

6030,243386,"An unyielding two-way defenceman, Jakob Chychrun is a rising star with a toolbox bursting at the seams. Consistently displays elite four-way skating ability and is not afraid to throw his weight around physically. Plays with poise and composure through high pressure situations and, with the puck on his stick, can direct the play up-ice. Exhibits a particularly potent shot that works its magic on the power play and on the forecheck. Excellent first pass and uses his vision and awareness to keep the puck moving in the direction of the opposition's tail or to a teammate with more time and space. Defensively adept at tracking the puck and staying a step ahead of the opposition. Proactive with his stick and body, exerting pressure on the opposition and forcing them to make hurried decisions. All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way defender who competes with pro-level drive and makes his authoritative presence felt at both ends of the ice. (Curtis Joe, EP 2016)
